                    A letter of appreciation for the donation from Rintaro Mori (Ogai), Director of the Tokyo Imperial Household Museum in 1920, still collects in the local museum archives. There are about five pots, some of which are believed to be urns. Cremation spread to the imperial family, aristocrats, priests and other people of high rank from the Heian period onwards.<br />
                    The Koasukadate site, just in front of Sutra Mound, is a complex of site dating from the early Jomon Period to the Muromochi Period. The under ground burial was practised in this area from the Jomon period until the Showa period.<br />
                    This area, where Tendaiji Temple is located, is a base with a place of rituals that continues to this day. This alone makes it worthy of World Heritage status.

                    The 'Juurininhozou' is located on the north side of the Gallery of Horyuji Treasures at the Tokyo National Museum.<br />
                    During the war, along with the 'Rokuso-an', it was secretly evacuated to the storehouse of the Odajima and Omori families in Joboji. Both families were raw lacquer merchants. The evacuation took place when Matsuda Gonroku was a professor at the Tokyo National University of Fine Arts and Music, and the unusually large number of Joboji bowls selected in the 'Jidai Bowl Taikan' published in the year World War II began is probably due to the fact that the area was an important military goods production area.<br />
                    In the Meiji era (1868-1912), when paraffin began to be imported from the West, lacquer wax was no longer needed and the number of lacquer trees declined sharply.<br />
                    The Japanese military stopped using raw lacquer for bomb detonators, resulting in a sharp decline.<br />
                    It has been designated a World Intangible Heritage Site as a restoration technique for cultural property and has barely escaped extinction.<br />
                    It is peaceful and original to use lacquer to make things me use, like the nest of an paper wasp.

It is often said that poison oak should not be faked, which is understandable when you consider that it was used in bombs. I was not taught this technique at school.

                    The momentum of a nation: the 'clouds on the hill' model of technology : by Taizo Yakushiji, NTT Publishing.<br />
                    In this book,it describes the process of manufacturing artillery shells at the time. To take an extract: "A layer of Japanese paper is pasted around a brass mould, the paper is allowed to dry, and then the cylinder of the paper is pulled out. The cylinder of the washi paper paint japanese lacquer . After all that work, the tube is filled with Shimose powder."
                    <br />
                    I had heard from my lacquer department teacher that lacquer techniques were a state secret before the war, and I wondered if this was what he meant. A while ago, I did something like the picture at hemp of Hita City, Oita Prefecture Japan. Using basically the same materials and techniques as the lacquer excavated from Hokkaido 9,000 years ago, and made a prototype as one of the variations. I am not good at it, so I didn't have enough skill to mass produce it in a short time, so it ended up as a prototype. I was surprised that it was used for bombs.<br />
                    Perhaps it is a blessing that we can freely make the things we need in our daily life with lacquer.

                    Lacquer restoration of a sake bottle by Kitaoji Rosanjin <br />
                    Rosanjin's vessels are designed to look good with food served on them. Although the mainstream is to use barley lacquer kintsugi, it is more appropriate to use only strong and long-lasting lacquer for bonding. The lacquer is baked and dried at high temperatures to harden the chipped cross section. Afterwards, the outside gluing surface is colour-matched. The colour of the lacquer that dries well is completely different from the colour when it is applied and when it dries, making colour matching difficult. The lacquer with high transparency is easy to colour-match but does not dry easily. I do not set a delivery date for repairs until I am satisfied with the work.<br />
                    The restoration of the national treasure 'Gassho Clay Figure' from the late Jomon period used asphalt. Today, synthetic resins are also available. <br />
                    There are many different types, but the most pleasant way to join vessels is with lacquer.

                    Bowls thought to have been used for begging bowls. In India, this refers to an iron bowl, but lacquered bowls are also recognised in Japan. The word '𡑮' means to stick linen cloth over with lacquer. Many people want to keep using one good bowl. They probably have a strong image of this bowl. This bowl has the atmosphere of a Lotus receptacle. I like it because it is a perfect expression of use and beauty.<br />
                    I have previously reprinted it with Noshu linen from Tochigi Prefecture. I am planning to put it in a lacquered box and take it with me to the grave.<br />

                    Eleven years after the Great East Japan Earthquake, the Government has continued to operate nuclear power plants and even sold them abroad. It was pointed out early on that nuclear power plants would be targeted, but they have not quit.<br />
                    In Ukraine, they were invaded by Russia, which is dubbed as a memory of Japan's previous invasions of the Korean Peninsula and China.<br />

                    I like this story. I envy him for being able to act like this when he didn't know what to do. I didn't know what I could do.

                    Cups are used more often than soup or rice bowls.<br />
                    It is a favourite with the family. We use them many times a day, pouring hot water and cold drinks into them. I do not wash it every time, but at the end of the day, in the evening. I have never made a dry lacquer cup before because I was worried about the handle, but now I am satisfied with the result. I have recently received some hints from my family about how to make this dry lacquer cup and I think I will be able to make many different types. I'm working on it so that I can show it again this autumn.<br />
                    Lacquerware that is friendly to those in charge of household chores.<br />
                    The fact that I am a homehusband has a positive impact on my work, as the whole family takes turns to cook and wash the dishes.
                    I tried to imitate John Lennon, but I still couldn't get a passing grade from my wife. My daughter said to me "I feel like I talk to my dad more than my other friends", which is completely unrelated, but it was a relief.<br />

                    Start works of chopsticks at new year.<br />
                    Shaving the bamboo with a cutter makes it easier to use when eating noodles. The first take of Suri Lacquer. We repeat the process several times to get a beautiful lacquer surface.<br />
                    This year we will change the design and the process of lacquering of the handle to make it more durable . The price also goes up. It is not easy for people to buy our daily use lacquerware because they do not trust it. As it's hard to tell the difference in price at first glance. It may sound simple, I have to be sincere.<br />
                    If I move away from what we learned at university and become too self-process about our techniques, it makes us uneasy. However, I am also relieved when I find that what I am doing is an extension of what I learned in class. <br />
                    There is still a lot of room for improvement in the daily use lacquer bowl. I paint like a paper wasp. <br />
                    Simple lacquer bowls that suit everyday life. I want to master it.
