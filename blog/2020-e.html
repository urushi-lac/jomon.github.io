                    The site was located in the town of Joboji during the early Jomon period (10,000 to 7,000 BC). <br />
                    This is around the same period that the world's oldest lacquer burial remains were excavated in Hakodate. <br />
                    Although intermittent, artifacts dating back to the Muromachi period continue to be found. <br />
                    It is located at the foot of the mountain where Tendaiji Temple, famous for the Dharma talks of Jakucho Setouchi, is located, and the oldest artifacts owned by the temple are from the Northern and Southern Dynasties. The oldest artifacts in the temple's possession and site which is very interesting when combined with the ruins. <br />
                    During the investigation of the Tendaiji Temple "Mae Desk", we happened to find some gold leaf left in the groove of a flower carving. It is a pity that the stoneware excavated from the Koa Sukadate site did not show even the slightest trace of lacquer on it. The Jomon sites in the north-eastern part of Hokkaido have been recommended for inclusion in the World Heritage List, but it is a pity that Joboji, an important site for lacquer culture, is not included. <br />
                    At present, Ruins of Coasca Hall is not maintained as an archaeological site, and the lacquer burial accessories in Hakodate were burnt down. Is this a difficulty in the protection of cultural property?

                    Washi paper being stretched into a plaster mold. <br />

                    I'm trying to keep the basics that I learned at university, but also do things that are new to me. <br />
                    It is difficult to make domestic lacquer ware as cheap as possible. <br />
                    The look of the vermilion workbench is changing as the years go by. I'm not sure if it's the result of hard work.

                    A workbench made only of Japanese lacquer. There is another one under the vermilion workbench. <br />
                    Recently, I've been taking postcards for exhibitions on this. <br />
                    In the back is a glass plate, which is used to correct the level and wobble of the bottom of vessels. In the shrine, I keep my poison oak specimens and sap samples. When I get stuck on a project, looking at the sap and panels reminds me of various things and often gives me hints. <br />
                    In the "with Corona" era, we have been receiving orders from the Internet.<br />
                    It's best if you pick up a copy at the exhibition and decide for yourself, but this is one way to meet people.

                    I've been thinking about this recently and changing my production process. <br />
                    This year, it is a wooden mold for a dry-lacquer spoon to be used over and over again. <br />
                    This website was made with Brackets. <br />
                    It gives me more means to continue using it freely without ads. <br />
                    I continue to use older versions of both Irregular and Photoshop. <br />
                    The only thing I have trouble with is lacquer, as I can't use the cheaper ones and have to use other methods.

                    In order to prevent lacquer rash, it was common to deliver the product about a month after completion. <br />
                    In addition to the above, we now pack about a month earlier to prevent corona. <br />
                    I can also store them in a larger box, and when you hand them over to the courier, you only need to take out the shipping box, which is also safe for the courier. <br />
                    One of the first things I was taught when I joined the lacquer course at the university was to make sure the cleaners didn't get a rash.
                    <br />
                    Recently, I have finally come to understand what I was taught back then.

                    A very common local city. As a result, ideas for the production of lacquerware for everyday use began to emerge.<br />
                    Now I am happy to be in this place and I am responsible for my work.

                    It was November when we decided to send the saplings. It usually takes quite a while because of the quarantine. <br />
                    This was the only shipping company that was able to meet the requirement of delivering the saplings before the end of 2001. <br />
                    <br />
                    I want to share the appeal of lacquer, which was born in Japan, with people overseas. That is what I wanted to do.<br />
                    Recently, I have begun to see the shape of my own theory of the Japanese origin of lacquer.

                <p1>This year, too, we will use raw lacquer from Joboji. <br />
                    Last year, there was no lacquering process due to the restoration of Nikko.<br />
                    It seems that the sales of the entire association were tough. <br /> I also have to admit that the amount I buy depends on sales.
                    <br />
                    The lacquer that only the lacquer scratchers of Joboji can produce. I would like to have such a lacquer.
                    <br /><br />
                    This year too, I have started to create my works again with some worries.
